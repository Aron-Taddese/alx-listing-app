# ALX Listing App

## Project Overview

The **ALX Listing App** is designed as a clone of an Airbnb listing page. The primary goal is to create a user-friendly platform where users can browse, create, and manage property listings. The application aims to provide an intuitive interface with features such as search, filtering, and user authentication.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories:

- **components/**: 
  - This directory contains reusable React components that represent different parts of the application. Examples include:
    - **ListingCard.js**: Displays individual property listings.
    - **Navbar.js**: Provides navigation links for the application.
    - **SearchBar.js**: Allows users to search for listings based on criteria.

- **interfaces/**: 
  - This directory defines TypeScript interfaces or types used throughout the application. This helps in maintaining type safety and improving code readability. Examples include:
    - **Listing.ts**: Defines the structure of a listing object.
    - **User.ts**: Outlines the properties of a user object.

- **constants/**: 
  - This directory stores constant values that are used across the app. Examples include:
    - **apiEndpoints.js**: Contains API endpoint URLs for fetching data.
    - **actionTypes.js**: Defines action types for Redux or state management.

- **public/assets/**: 
  - This directory holds static assets like images, icons, and stylesheets that are publicly accessible and can be served directly. Examples include:
    - **images/**: Contains property images and icons.
    - **styles/**: Holds global CSS styles for the app.
